This Jupyter notebook allows you to use the full archive search endpoint for Twitter's API v2.
You must be approved for the Academic Research track to use this script.

The last cell of the notebook allows you to specify the parameters for your search. You will need a bearer token to authenticate.

NOTE: The endpoint allows you to make only 1 request per second and 300 requests per 15 minutes. Accordingly, if your query returns more than 150k tweets, this script will sleep for 10 minutes before resuming.
